# Further Maths Presentation
## Summary
The presentation is on Newton's method for approximating the solutions to equations and specifically using it to approximate $\pi$ to 15 decimal places

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook you can click the above badge or you can clone the repository and run it with jupyter.  
The presentation is stored in the 'Maths Presentation' iPython Notebook.  
When the notebook is run, you should use the Kernel > Restart and Run All option to ensure that the interactive sections run correctly.  

## Temporary Notes
- Add this markdown to the end of the presentation
In reality, we've approximated $\pi$ to more than $15$ decimal places, but the python kernel running this cannot print more than $15$ decimal places.  
$15$ decimal places is however, rather coincidentally, the number of places used by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in their most accurate calculations.  
The reason for this is that if you were to calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of the distance of Voyager $1$ from the earth, which is $12.5$ billion miles, using $\pi$ rounded to $15$ decimal places, you would be off by about $1.5$ inches.  
To calculate the circumference of the visible universe to an accuracy within the diameter of a hydrogen atom, you wouldn't need more than 40 decimal places of $\pi$.  
As such, in $10$ (or probably fewer) iterations, we have reached an accuracy of pi that is good enough for interplanetary travel.
